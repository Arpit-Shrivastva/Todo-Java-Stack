# ToDo Backend

# Backend - Spring Boot:

Develop a RESTful API using Spring Boot to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for todo items. Each todo item will be an entity with properties like id, title, description, completed, and dueDate.

# Microservices Architecture:

Split the backend into multiple microservices, such as TodoService for handling todo items and UserService for managing user accounts. Each microservice will have its own database and handle specific functionalities.

# Database:

Use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing todo items and user data. Implement JPA (Java Persistence API) repositories to interact with the database in a Spring Boot application.

# Security:

Implement security measures using Spring Security to manage user authentication and authorization, ensuring that users can only access their own todo items.
